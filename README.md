# llm_agents_tutorials

Welcome to the AI Agents tutorials repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and building AI agents using various frameworks and tools such as LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI and from scratch. It also includes the use of different tools to ensure accurate results. This project utilizes resources from blogs, books, and short courses by DeepLearning.AI, and data provided by DeepLearning.AI for learning purposes.

This repository is aimed at developers who are learning to build AI agents using various frameworks. The goal is to provide a structured learning path and a practical implementation guide.

## Setup Instructions

#### Creating a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, follow these steps:

* Open your terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```python
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a virtual environment named venv in your project directory.

#### Activating the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

On Windows:
```python
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS and Linux:
```python
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### Installing Requirements
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### Deactivating the Virtual Environment
To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
```python
deactivate
```


## Usage
After setting up the virtual environment and installing the requirements, you can start using the modules in the src/ directory. Each module contains its own implementation and usage instructions. Explore the code and the provided data to understand how AI agents are built and utilized.


## Updates
This repository will be updated regularly as new learning materials and insights are discovered. Stay tuned for the latest updates and improvements.


## Credits
This project is built using the knowledge and data provided by:

* Blogs, books, and short courses by DeepLearning.AI.
* Various online resources and tutorials on AI agent development.
* Data provided by DeepLearning.AI for learning purposes.
